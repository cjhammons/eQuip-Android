# eQuip Android
This is the Android Application for world-beloved failed startup eQuip. The app made it to beta before we decided to shelve the idea. This code is here for archival/resume purposes, the server is no longer functioning so if you were to download and run the application you wouldn't be able to do anything with it. 

You can also see some of the backend server code for the app [here](https://github.com/cjhammons/eQuip-Cloud-Functions)

### Technologies used
- Java/Kotlin
- Retrofit
- Stripe
- Algolia
- Firebase
- Picasso

## eQuip's Premise 

The premise of eQuip was to allow users to list their unused outdoor equipment (our initial focus was on kayaks and bikes in particular) for rental to other users.
